Currently I am a CS student at the <strong>ATEI of Crete, Department of Informatics Engineering</strong> in Iraklion. I am interested
in working in operating systems and embedded devices.

I work as a lab assistant at the AES (Architecture and Embedded Systems) lab, at the Department of Informatics Engineering, under the
guidance of professor Dr. Georgios Kornaros. I am developing Linux device drivers for the fpga-based devices, created in the lab, for use in GNU/Linux systems.
