##Hello  world! I am Manolis.

<p>My name is <strong>Manolis Ragkousis</strong> and I am a 23 years old CS
Student from Paros, Greece.</p>

Currently I am a student at the <strong>ATEI of Crete, Department of
Informatics Engineering</strong> in Iraklion. I am interested
in working in operating systems, embedded devices and application developement.

I am contributing to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/">GNU Guix functional package manager for the GNU system</a>.
I am working on the "GuixSD on GNU Hurd" port. It started as a GSoC Project and you can check more at
the following links.
